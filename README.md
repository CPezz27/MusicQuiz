# MusicQuiz

MusicQuiz is a program that allows the user to play a music quiz based on providing an answer 
(1 or 2) based on which of two randomly chosen artists has recorded more albums. 
After each "quiz", the program will ask if the user wants to continue. 
If the user types anything other than "y", the program stops; otherwise, the program will continue to ask which of two artists has recorded more albums.

The program is based on the Deezer API, and there is an external program used to extract the IDs of the artists to be included in the quiz, which are then saved in a JSON file.
